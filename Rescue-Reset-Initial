    C. Restart the router and flash the firmware in emergency restore mode
    http://forums.dlink.com/index.php?topic=44909.msg162511#msg162511
    1. Make sure the router is unplugged.
    2. Plug an ethernet cable from your router to your computer
    3. Set your PC to have a static IP of 192.168.0.2 and subnet mask of 255.255.255.0
       - Control Panel -> Network and Internet -> Network Connections
       - Right click on your ethernet adapter -> Properties
       - TCP/IPv4 -> Properties
       - IP address: 192.168.0.2
       - Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
       - Default gateway: blank
       - Preferred DNS server: blank
       - Alternate DNS server: blank
    4. Press and hold the RESET button of the DIR-505L for ~5 seconds. Continue
       holding the RESET button, and plug the router into a power outlet.
       Continue holding the RESET button for ~10 seconds, or so, then let go.
    5. Open a web browser to 192.168.0.1. You should see an EMERGENCY FLASHING page.
       Click browse/upload, locate the *dir-505*-factory.bin, and upload it. If the
       firmware is note accepted, see the NOTE below.
    6. Give the router ~several~ minutes to flash the firmware. When it's done,
       unplug the router from the power outlet. Don't unplug the ethernet cable yet,
       we will need to communicate with the router via ethernet cable until we can
       turn the wifi on in the OpenWrt settings.
    7. Go back to your TCP/IPv4 properties and set your settings back to "Obtain an
       IP address automatically", and "Obtain DNS server address automatically".
       Plug the router back into the power outlet.
    8. Open up a commandline window and try to "ping 192.168.1.1". If you get a
       response, we can communicate with the router. Onto the next step.
     
    NOTE: If the firmware is not accepted, you may have to slightly hex edit the
    OpenWrt *dir-505*-factory.bin. If you open the official firmware in a hex editor
    (dir505L_fw_101.bin), you will notice that it says, "505LA1" somewhere around
    hex offset 0x30. That is your model number. If you look at the same offset in
    your OpenWrt firmware (*dir-505*-factory.bin), you will notice it says, "505A1",
    instead. This is an older model number. Simply change the "505A1" into a
    "505LA1". See below for an example.
     
    dir505L_fw_101.bin:
    0x0030      52 35 30 35 4C 41 31 2D 33 00 00 00 00 00 44 45     R505LA1-3.....DE
     
    (old) *dir-505*-factory.bin:
    0x0030      52 35 30 35 41 31 2D 33 00 00 00 00 00 00 44 45     R505A1-3......DE
     
    (new) *dir-505*-factory.bin:
    0x0030      52 35 30 35 4C 41 31 2D 33 00 00 00 00 00 44 45     R505LA1-3.....DE
     
     
    D. Open a telnet session with your router
    http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin
    1. Open up a commandline window and do,
           telnet 192.168.1.1
    2. If you connect to the router, set a new password for root by typing,
           passwd
    3. Once your new password is set, telnet will be disabled and ssh will be
       enabled. Go ahead and type "exit" to quit your telnet session, and then open
       up a new ssh session with 192.168.1.1 using your favorite SSH client/utility.
     
     
    E. Open an SSH session with your router and configure the network
    http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/firstlogin
    http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/basic.config
    http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/wireless
    http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/internet.connection
    http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci/network
    http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/luci.essentials
    1. Open a new ssh session with 192.168.1.1 as user root,
           ssh root@192.168.1.1
    2. If you successfully open an ssh connection, go to step 3. If you get a
       "connection refused" error, see the NOTE below.
    3. It's time to set up the network. In your SSH terminal, run the following
       commands to set up your router's ethernet (eth1) to connect to the internet
       and split your router's LAN and WAN.
           uci set network.wan=interface
           uci set network.wan.proto=dhcp
           uci set network.wan.ifname=eth1
           uci del network.lan.ifname
           uci commit
    4. Now enable wifi by running these commands.
           uci set wireless.@wifi-device[0].disabled=0
           uci commit wireless
           wifi
    5. You can disconnect the ethernet cable from the router to your computer. Plug
       your internet ethernet cable into the router, and then connect to the new
       "OpenWrt" wifi hotspot.
    6. You may have to power cycle the router, your modem, or both, but eventually
       you should have the internet plugged into the DIR-505L via ethernet, you
       should be connected to the "OpenWrt" wifi hotspot, and you should be able to
       use the internet. Now it's time to install the web gui, LuCI.
     
    NOTE: If you get a "connection refused" error, wait a few minutes and try,
    again. It can take a few minutes for the SSH server to begin working after
    telnet shuts down. If you can neither connect through telnet or ssh, you may
    need to do a factory reset. You can try to repeat the steps to get to the
    EMERGENCY FLASH page, or you can use OpenWrt's built-in failsafe mode. Activate
    failsafe mode by repeatedly pressing the WPS button on the DIR-505L as soon as
    you plug it into a power outlet. Failsafe mode will ~NOT~ activate if anything
    is plugged into the router's ethernet port, so make sure you unplug your
    ethernet cable before trying to activate failsafe mode. If failsafe mode
    activates, the green power LED should begin to flash ~very~ rapidly. You will
    then need to change your ethernet adapter's IP address, similar to before. Set
    your IP address to 192.168.1.2 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0. You should be
    able to open a telnet session with 192.168.1.1. Once in failsafe mode with a
    telnet session open, you should follow the steps, here.
    http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/generic.failsafe#in.failsafe.mode
     
    Use these commands in the telnet session to factory reset and reboot your
    OpenWrt router.
    mount_root
    firstboot
    mtd -r erase rootfs_data
     
    When the router reboots, you'll repeat the process like you just flashed a new
    OpenWrt. Return your ethernet adapter settings to obtain an IP address and DNS
    automatically, open a telnet session, use passwd, and try to open an ssh
    session, again. Continue from the ssh session. If you get "connection refused",
    again, you may have to delete your SSH authentication certificates. On a *nix
    system, these might be found in the folder, "~/.ssh/". I had this problem, and I
    was able to connect via SSH once I deleted ~/.ssh/known_hosts.
     
     
    F. Install the web GUI, LuCI
    1. You should be connected to your router via wifi. SSH to your router, located
       at 192.168.1.1, and run the folllowing commands to install LuCI.
           opkg update
           opkg install luci-ssl
    2. When the installation is successful, run these commands to start the web gui
       and enable it on router boot.
           /etc/init.d/uhttpd start
           /etc/init.d/uhttpd enable
    3. Open your browser to 192.168.1.1, and login to your new web GUI. We're going
       to update the version of OpenWrt, now by using LuCI to flash the
       *dir-505*-sysupgrade.bin.
    4. Once logged into the web gui, go to System > Backup / Flash Firmware. Flash
       your *dir-505*-sysupgrade.bin, and make sure to check, "Keep settings".
    5. When the firmware is flashed and the router reboots, you need to re-enable
       the LuCI web gui. After reconnecting to the "OpenWrt" wifi hotspot, simply
       open an ssh connection to your router (ssh root@192.168.1.1), and run these
       commands, again.
           opkg update
           opkg install luci-ssl
           /etc/init.d/uhttpd start
           /etc/init.d/uhttpd enable
    6. Finally, you can exit the ssh session, point your browser to 192.168.1.1,
       login to your web gui, and configure your router to your liking.
     
     
    G. Set your router to reboot once per week
    http://www.smallbusinesstech.net/more-complicated-instructions/openwrt/configuring-openwrt-to-automatically-reboot-every-week-1
    1. If you don't need the router to be connected to the internet without
       interruption, I recommend setting it up to reboot once per week to maintain
       stability. To do that, login to LuCI and browse to System > Scheduled Tasks.
       This page allows you to edit the crontab file. Add the following line to the
       scheduled tasks textbox (i.e., crontab file),
           0 3 * * 0 reboot
       The first number denotes the minute (0-59). In this case, 0 represents the top of the hour.
       The second number denotes the hour (0-23). In this case, 3 represents 3 AM.
       The third number denotes the day of the month (1-31). In this case, * matches any day of the month, so this field is ignored.
       The fourth number denotes the month of the year (1-12). In this case, * matches any day of the month, so this field is ignored.
       The fifth number denotes the day of the week (0-6) beginning with Sunday. In this case, 0 represents Sunday.
       The final item is the command to be run. The crontab runs with root privileges, so it has power to reboot the device.
     
     
    H. Use alternate DNS servers
    1. You may be interested to use alternate DNS servers instead of your default
       ISP ones. To do this, open up your LuCI web gui and go to
       Network > Interfaces > WAN > Edit > Advanced Settings. Uncheck the "Use DNS
       servers advertised by peer" box, and then enter whichever servers you want in
       the "Use custom DNS servers" box. Some recommendations include:
           Level 3: 4.2.2.1 and 4.2.2.2
           Google DNS: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
           OpenDNS: 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220
           DNS Advantage: 156.154.70.1 and 156.154.71.1
       Also try GRC's DNS benchmark tool.
       https://www.grc.com/dns/Benchmark.htm
     
     
    I. Install more packages
    1. You might want to install some packages to further enhance your router's
       features. Useful packages might include:
           - UPnP (luci-app-upnp, miniupnpd)
           - Dynamic DNS (luci-app-ddns, ddns-scripts)
     
     
    J. Other notes
    1. Some people are having problems resolving hostnames from their internal
    network. For instance, if they plug their network ethernet cable directly into
    their computer, they can access hostname "example", but if they try to connect
    to that hostname from their OpenWrt router, it doesn't work. Instead, they have
    to use the whole domain name, "example.domain.com". To fix this, people have
    been going to their LuCI web GUI, then to Network > DHCP and DNS. In "General
    Settings", uncheck "Domain required", "Authoritative", and "Rebind protection".
    Then in "Advanced Settings" uncheck "Filter private". I personally have this
    hostname resolving problem, but unchecking these options didn't fix it. It seems
    like it fixed a lot of other people's, though. Your mileage my vary.
